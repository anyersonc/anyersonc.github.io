As the drain voltage $V_\\mathrm{D}$ increases beyond a few tenths of a volt $(0.1V)$ the voltage in the substrate near the drain increases, which reduces the potential difference between the gate and the substrate. This causes a reduction of the concentration of the minority carriers in the inversion layer near the drain. This is shown in the following figure (a). This narrowing of the channel increases its resistance and causes the slope of the $I_\\mathrm{D}-V_\\mathrm{D}$ curve to decrease.
