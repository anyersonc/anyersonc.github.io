        "At this point we have established one equation relating xp and xn (11.30), but because we have two unknowns, we require a second independent equation relating them in order to locate both endpoints of the depletion region. A second equation relating $x_p$ and $x_n$ can be found by considering the electric potential within the junction. In order to determine the electric potential, we will first need to establish the electric field, which can be calculated from the charge distribution. We begin by substituting the charge density we found using the depletion approximation into the one dimensional version of Gauss’s law in differential form from (11.25).\n",
