# Introduction

This notebook will explore the properties and behavior of the PN junction and its further application to the MOSFET.

## PN Junction
The $pn$ junction is formed by the union of p-type and n-type semiconductor materials. We will start by understanding the formation and characteristics of the depletion region, which is a crucial aspect of the $pn$ junction. 

We will start by exploring the fundamentals of p-type and n-type semiconductors. Understanding their individual properties is crucial for grasping how they work together in a $pn$ junction. Next, we will dive into the mechanics of the pn junction, examining how the combination of p-type and n-type semiconductors creates a unique and essential electronic component.

You will learn to sketch the $I-V$ characteristic of a pn junction and understand the behavior of current in relation to electron and hole movements. By the end of this book, you will be able to analyze and comprehend the intricate workings of diodes and transistors in electronic circuits.
