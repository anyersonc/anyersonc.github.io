This notebook will explore the properties and behavior of the PN junction, which is formed by the union of p-type and n-type semiconductor materials. We will start by understanding the formation and characteristics of the depletion region, which is a crucial aspect of the PN junction. 

Then, we will examine the energy band diagrams to visualize the movement of charge carriers and the resulting current flow across the junction. Finally, we will learn how to sketch the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curve of a PN junction, which is a graphical representation of the relationship between the applied voltage and the resulting current flow. This curve is essential for understanding the rectifying behavior of a PN junction, which forms the basis for its use in various electronic applications. 

Throughout this notebook, we will use a combination of theoretical explanations, graphical visualizations, and numerical examples to reinforce the concepts and develop a solid understanding of the PN junction's operation and characteristics.
