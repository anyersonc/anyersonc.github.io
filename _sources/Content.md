# Introduction

This notebook will explore the properties and behavior of the PN junction and its further application to the MOSFET.

## PN Junction
The $pn$ junction is formed by the union of p-type and n-type semiconductor materials. We will start by understanding the formation and characteristics of the depletion region, which is a crucial aspect of the $pn$ junction. 

We will start by exploring the fundamentals of p-type and n-type semiconductors. Understanding their individual properties is crucial for grasping how they work together in a $pn$ junction. Next, we will dive into the mechanics of the pn junction, examining how the combination of p-type and n-type semiconductors creates a unique and essential electronic component.

You will learn to sketch the $I-V$ characteristic of a pn junction and understand the behavior of current in relation to electron and hole movements. By the end of this book, you will be able to analyze and comprehend the intricate workings of diodes and transistors in electronic circuits.

## MOSFET

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors), which are essential components in modern electronics. 

We will explore the structure and operation of MOSFETs, including their four-terminal design and how voltage applied across two terminals controls the current through the other two. We will delve into the ideal diode model and the constant voltage drop model to understand diode behavior, which lays the foundation for grasping MOSFET functionality. 

We will also examine the MOS-C (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor-Capacitor), crucial for field-effect devices, and discuss the MOSFET operating principles, such as the creation of an inversion layer that allows current flow when the device is "on." The content will cover the I-V characteristics of MOSFETs, showing how the gate voltage influences the drain current. By the end of this course, you will be equipped to analyze electronic circuits with diodes and transistors, calculate voltages, currents, and power consumption, and understand the different regions of operation for MOSFETs.
